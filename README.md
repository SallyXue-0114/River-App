To create the webpage homepage I used a tutorial video on youtube since I didn't have much web development experience. After getting a basic outline for the website I designed the UI interface by adding my own images and changing the color theme of the website by using a gradient. I also edited some pop ups on the website and edited the navbar. I did this through react app in visual studio code.

I create the main map page. I marked main rivers in the world with pop-up buttons, and when the users click on a specific river, they can see basic information of it, as well as a sidebar of details (animal, plants, and culture in that region). And if they click on the specific area, it will show more specific information.

I create the 'upload file' page and the 'description' page. 

I also do the data collection part. I search for the basic information (latitudes and longitudes) and the fauna/flora and cultural group information related to our six rivers. I incorporate these sources into a csv file.

Besides, I create the presentation of our project.
